### Offline Tadoku Contest Log ###

-----

Tadoku-tan is an offline app for recording and scoring reading according to the [Tadoku Reading Contest](http://readmod.wordpress.com/) as run on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TadokuBot).  The default ruleset included is for Japanese, however the rules are stored as plaintext and an interface to easily update them from within the program is in the works.
